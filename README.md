# money notes and ponderings

I'm trying to learn about how money works. Coming at it from a "morality of money" angle (to start with).

My starting point is an intuitive feeling that making money from money could be immoral. It's something I'm not interested in doing as it feels like I should do some work for money. It is often possible for people to get money through no effort or merit of their own, so being able to earn money from that money doesn't seem quite right.

I'm just at the beginning of trying to base my thoughts in a deeper knowledge and understanding of this topic though. Whilst I have an opinionated/idealogical starting point I want to try and minimise the impact of this on my research (but not my judgement).

This repository is intended to be a working brain dump of my progress on the topic (as I'm trying to be more open in life). I would welcome constructive and unbiased contributions on this topic :)

concept of market goods vs "higher level" goods

putting some things into a market, it can change the character of the activity, putting financial incentives on things changes the thing

examples - swiss story of residents people less likely to accept a nuclear waste facility in their area if they are offered money as they don't want to feel like they are being bribed whereas before they felt they were doing civic good, another one something about charity people being better performing without a commission.

marketization leading to more social segregation

my thoughts: there are powerful forces inside humans we can harness to do good. people work hard for common good, for civic responsiblity, for a moral feel good feeling (terrible sentence!). people also like nice relaxing and easy lives, harmonious working environments, flexible hours (to go to the doctor, pick up kids, etc), not too much pressure. perhaps if all those forces are not enough THEN the market is useful. maybe.

## random video/rant found on youtube "Why one SHOULD strive to acquire wealth/money (from ALL perspectives...self-serving...serving others)"

stupid video, couldn't watch it all. but I'd like to understand his arguments in more depth.

he quotes somebody saying money is time and energy and nothing else. which is absurd. time and energy can't be stored in a bank account. or transferred. or invested (directly). and you can spend time and energy without it being related to money.

too radical sounding for my liking. full of emotional language and asserted truths. but I think he likely has some very good points to consider. just gotta extract them....

says 40% of our prices is made up of usary passed down the chain

a key part of the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=luIvylMyMOE#t=1928

* he says it is bad because the people with the money are working when they get the money (kind of)
* he differentiated earned vs unearned income
* QUESTION: what is "earned" income
* argues ending redistribution, in any direction
* issue of passing wealth down through family
* money creation? creates money when you get it, disppears once get repaid? huh?
* compound interest. has a compounding period, then the income earned goes back into the main fund.
* fractional reserve lending? what is this?
