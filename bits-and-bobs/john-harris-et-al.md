  * [this post](http://www.internationalskeptics.com/forums/showpost.php?p=5163410&postcount=159) is from someone who used to believe in it but changed, and here they outline some of their reasons for doing so

This is a fairly wild/radical perspective on things from my current readings thus far. http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/John_Harris has some writings about him, including the FOTL (freeman on the land) *manifesto* (at the bottom), although I can't find this on an official website. It also says the movement claims there is a massive global conspiracy centred around the Holy See in Rome, and St Michael's Mount in Cornwall.

Also related to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Icke who talks about *a secret group of reptilian humanoids called the Babylonian Brotherhood (including George W. Bush, Queen Elizabeth II, Kris Kristofferson and Boxcar Willie) controls humanity, and that many prominent figures are reptilian*.

## Notes

listings on business website, companies generate profit:

* house of commons is a company
* labour party is a company
* politicons are compnaies (Gordon Brown, David Cameron)
* police are companies
* ministry of justice
* all courts

difference between consent (Acts, and Statutory Instruments) and non-consent (common law).

no choice to join society.

statute. "consent of the governed" - not law (force of law used, but not law)

person vs man/woman? huh

United Kingdom Plc. - what does this mean

United Kingdom Coporation Ltd.

employees are all of us (civil servants and us)

having a national insurance number means you are an employee

the police are for-profit companies (making profit for directors/shareholders), profit comes from enforcing the rules of the corporation

courts are for-profit companies

house of lords is a coporation

lawful vs legal - massive difference

police man vs police officer

police man (human being)

* uphold common law
* serve and protect

police officer (fiction)

* corporate empoyee
* revenue collector
* enforce statute

police for training is going towards the "police officer" vision

made a chief inspector overrule statue and enforce common law

no violence

common law justidiction. no civil law state statute applies unless you consent.

if you give your name to them you are entering the civil statitory world. you do not need to answer them.


the profits generate statutes/policy to generate profit.

they can only act if you contract with them. you have to give name and address and contract is created. on your person, not the man or woman (what is that difference?).

"real law of land" vs "coporate policy"

legalese is a language of the law society (what is the law society?)

"do not take a word of what I'm saying as the truth"

legalese:
* MUST is synonymous with MAY
* summons is synonymous with invitation
* understand and standunder (given authority over)

court is place of business, they will ask for your name. mr harris. "legal personality". focuses on "mr" as not his name.

a man cannot be acted on my statuses, only apply to a fictional entity - Mr JOHN HARRIS. titles are fictions because they dont' apply to human being. it's a "legal status" thing.

stack of:

- natural law 
- common law
- commercial policy (UCC)
- civil policy
- political policy

(are they are stack?)

natural/common law applies to him. knowing what is right and wrong ("it's inherit, you just know it" - I don't think so!)

companies are pieces of paper and not real.

common law vs statute rules/policy

only need to adhere to natural law, common law

common law applies to a man or a woman.

statute rules apply to the "person" when a man/woman consent to represent the person.

common law -> justice
statute rules -> summary judgement

courts only about making money from people breaking rules of contract.

you *are* a man/woman, you *have* a person.

you exist naturally.

"must never harm another or cause another any for of loss"
"free and unlimited ability to contract * settle debt in private under commericial law"
where are these from?
