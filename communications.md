# communications

I think this page is just about how I communicate as I get asked sometimes. But maybe it should be more about communications in general.

I don't use mobile phone communications at the moment. I have the device, but no SIM card. It gets data over wifi when I am in a building with wifi access, otherwise it is closed from the outside world.

A few motivating reasons:

* privacy - https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/problem-mobile-phones
* keep myself more focussed on what is infront of me right now
* reduce my dependencies in life
* a little life challenge
* keep costs down

I use [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) a lot for short form messages - you can connect with me here http://telegram.me/nicksellen

And email for everything else, you can email me at hello@nicksellen.co.uk

(and a little bit of whatsapp and threema too)
