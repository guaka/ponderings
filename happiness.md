What is it and how do I get it?

## contentment vs happiness

> High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being

The general conclusion I have read in other studies (which ones?) but I liked the separation of "life evaluation" (how close to the best possible life I am) and emotional wellbeing. It would seem pretty plausible that with an active philosophy (not just mainstream idea of life), and an appropriate community this 75000USD/year figure could be reduced too. I didn't actually understand whether this meant combined household income or not though. 

This was an aside mentioned with the article too:

> A recent psychological study using priming methods provided suggestive evidence of a possible association between high income and a reduced ability to savor small pleasures

Enjoying small pleasures seems pretty important to me. A particularly tasty orange perhaps.

* Higher Purpose Meaning - Being part of something bigger than yourself
