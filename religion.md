# religion

This is a big topic! And a bit scary actually, I like a world where people are free to have whatever relegion or beliefs they want. I don't discuss this topic very much in person as it usually doesn't go anywhere.

I am an atheist, but that just says I don't believe in God, what do I believe in?

[Humanism](https://humanism.org.uk/) is the closest thing to a "relgion for atheists" that I've found, and it works for me! It says:

> this life is the only life we have, that the universe is a natural phenomenon with no supernatural side, and that we can live ethical and fulfilling lives on the basis of reason and humanity

Some NAQ (never asked questions):

## Why do you think there is no god?

All the gods I've heard about cannot be subject to any proof - *by their very definition*. This seems a bit suspicious to me, if I *wanted* to conjure up the idea of a god that people would believe in, this would be a key property.

Also, why does god care so much about the minutae of detail on this one planet, like who I sleep with. Again, it sounds suspciously like the kind of thing humans would come up.

Also also, religion seems to have had to adapt to incoporate various discoveries of science over time (like what?).

## Why would people invent the concept of god if there isn't one?

* we need *some* kind of framework to try to understand things we cannot explain, god is a catch-all explanation
* it works as a great way to get people to live their lives in certain ways (for good or bad)
* our minds are not rational by default and are prone to fantasy

When I compare the plausibility of those things happening compared to there being a god, I'm afraid god does not win.

## You can't prove it?

I don't believe you can prove god exists or not. My lack of belief in god is a faith.
